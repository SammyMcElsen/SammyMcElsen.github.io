-The fully resposive navigation bar is featured on the top of every page and includes links to the Homepage, Manga-Page, Manhwa-Page and the Manhua-Page. It has a hover function, which allows the User to easily identify on what page they are about to click.

-The footer includes a copyright by me and a disclaimer for the accurateness of this website. Because the topic of which book title is the best is for everyone slightly different, it is good to mention that the facts and represented comics may not be accurate for every User.

-The pages for Manga, Manhwa and Manhua all have one added sentence, to inform them on where the voting for the top-10-picks for the books was conducted.

### The Sub-Pages for Manga, Manhwa and Manhua also include the following features:

+ The Audio-Speaker
