    <h1>The history behind Manga</h1>
    <h2>Here we will show you a little, how Manga came to be.</h2>
    <p>Manga first originated from emakimoto, these are illustrated handscrolls and are dated back to the 12th century.</p>
    <p>During the Edo period (1603-1867), a book of drawings titled Toba Ehon further developed what would later be called manga.</p>
    <p>It is suggested, that kibyoshi, picture books from the late 18th century, may have been the world's first comic books.</p>
    <p>A big growth of artistic inspiration occured in the post-war-period. Thus a lot of earlier Manga-works depict wars or the times right after the war.</p>
    <p>Boys and young men became some of the earliest readers of manga after World War II.</p>
    <p>Between 1950 and 1969, an increasingly large readership for Manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres.</p>
    <p>These two genres were shōnen Manga, directed at boys and shojo Manga, directed at girls.</p>
    <p>By the turn of the 21st century, manga "achieved worldwide popularity"</p>

    <h1>A few interesting facts about Manga</h1>
    <h2>Here you can read about a few interesting facts about Manga.<h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Why Manga characters have so large eyes:</h3></li>
      <p>This universal trend was started by Osamu Tezuka, creator of the Manga "Astroboy".</p>
      <p>Specifically, it sprang from his love of Walt Disney animation, especially the movie "Bambi".</p>
      <p>Because Tezuka's work is a foundation of contemporary Manga, this trait became a defining feature of its character designs.</p>
      <li><h3>The bestselling Manga of all time:</h3></li>
      <p>That price goes to "One Piece".</p>
      <p>This Manga sold over 500 million copys worldwide, as of August 2022.</p>
      <p>The Manga "Dragon Ball" follows closely on the 2nd place.</p>
      <li><h3>The right way to read Manga:</h3></li>
      <p>Japanese is read from right to left, so naturally, Manga would be read the same way.</p>
      <p>Because of this, the first page of a Manga is in western standards actually the last.</p>

              <li><p>Description:</p> Punpun Onodera is a normal 11-year-old boy living in Japan. Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle—though nonetheless startling—turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naïve boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought. As his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.</li>

Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Years later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.</li>

However, Thorfinn is not part of the group for the plunder it entails—instead, for having caused his family great tragedy, the boy has vowed to kill Askeladd in a fair duel. Not yet skilled enough to defeat him, but unable to abandon his vengeance, Thorfinn spends his boyhood with the mercenary crew, honing his skills on the battlefield among the war-loving Danes, where killing is just another pleasure of life. One day, when Askeladd receives word that Danish prince Canute has been taken hostage, he hatches an ambitious plot—one that will decide the next King of England and drastically alter the lives of Thorfinn, Canute, and himself. Set in 11th-century Europe, Vinland Saga tells a bloody epic in an era where violence, madness, and injustice are inescapable, providing a paradise for the battle-crazed and utter hell for the rest who live in it.</li>

However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: "I hate basketball" and "I need a girlfriend." Haruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.</li>

In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead. As a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement.

His aggressive nature has won him the collective reproach and fear of his village, leading him and his best friend, Matahachi Honiden, to run away in search of something grander than provincial life. The pair enlist in the Toyotomi army, yearning for glory—but when the Toyotomi suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tokugawa Clan at the Battle of Sekigahara, the friends barely make it out alive. After the two are separated, Shinmen returns home on a self-appointed mission to notify the Hon'iden family of Matahachi's survival. He instead finds himself a wanted criminal, framed for his friend's supposed murder based on his history of violence. Upon being captured, he is strung up on a tree and left to die. An itinerant monk, the distinguished Takuan Soho, takes pity on the "devil child," secretly freeing Shinmen and christening him with a new name to avoid pursuit by the authorities: Musashi Miyamoto.</li>
