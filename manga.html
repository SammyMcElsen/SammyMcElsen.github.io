    <h2>The history behind Manga</h2>
    <h4>Here we will show you a little, how Manga came to be</h4>
    <p>Manga first originated from emakimoto, these are illustrated handscrolls and are dated back to the 12th century.</p>
    <p>During the Edo period (1603-1867), a book of drawings titled Toba Ehon further developed what would later be called manga.</p>
    <p>It is suggested, that kibyoshi, picture books from the late 18th century, may have been the world's first comic books.</p>
    <p>A big growth of artistic inspiration occured in the post-war-period. Thus a lot of earlier Manga-works depict wars or the times right after the war.</p>
    <p>Boys and young men became some of the earliest readers of manga after World War II.</p>
    <p>Between 1950 and 1969, an increasingly large readership for Manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres.</p>
    <p>These two genres were sh≈çnen Manga, directed at boys and shojo Manga, directed at girls.</p>
    <p>By the turn of the 21st century, manga "achieved worldwide popularity"</p>

    <h2>A few interesting facts about Manga</h2>
    <h4>Here you read about a few interesting facts about Manga</h4>
    <ul id="facts">
      <li><h5>Why Manga characters have so large eyes</h5></li>
      <p>This universal trend was started by Osamu Tezuka, creator of the Manga "Astroboy".</p>
      <p>Specifically, it sprang from his love of Walt Disney animation, especially the movie "Bambi".</p>
      <p>Because Tezuka's work is a foundation of contemporary Manga, this trait became a defining feature of its character designs.</p>
      <li><h5>The bestselling Manga of all time</h5></li>
      <p>That price goes to "One Piece".</p>
      <p>This Manga sold over 500 million copys worldwide, as of August 2022.</p>
      <p>The Manga "Dragon Ball" follows closely on the 2nd place.</p>
      <li><h5>The right way to read Manga</h5></li>
      <p>Japanese is read from right to left, so naturally, Manga would be read the same way.</p>
      <p>Because of this, the first page of a Manga is in western standards actually the last.</p>
